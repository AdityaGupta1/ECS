        <h2>CPU</h2>

        <p>A CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is the main logical and arithmetical core of the computer. In a way, it is
            the brain of the computer because it can perform calculations, process instructions, do I/O operations, and
            sort information. Without a CPU, a computer wouldn't be able to do anything - it would be a useless heap of
            metal sitting on your desk.</p>
        <p>A CPU has three parts - the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), the CU (Control Unit), and the cache. The ALU
            performs calculations on integers - it's responsible for your computer's arithmetical and logical
            operations. The CU controls the other two parts of the CPU by telling them how to execute the instructions
            in a program. The cache stores memory from the locations used most often, which reduces the average time and
            energy needed to access data from the main memory.</p>

    <!-- CPU Cooling -->
    <div>
        <h2>CPU Cooling</h2>
        <img class="section-image"

             alt="3-fan CPU cooling">
        <p>CPU cooling is an essential part of a computer. Heat can ruin computer parts and conductivity, so it's best
            to keep your hardware in an optimal temperature range. There are two types of cooling: active and
            passive.</p>
        <p>Active cooling requires energy to dissipate heat. An example is a fan system, like the one shown above. It
            expends energy, but it gets the job done well. Active cooling can make a lot of noise, which may be
            annoying, but it works very well.</p>
        <p>Passive cooling does not require energy to work - it simply needs to be there. An example is water cooling,
            because the water does not require energy. The water conducts the heat away from the CPU, and can dissipate
            the heat all by itself. However, this is not very efficient, and a liquid cooling system works better with a
            fan at the end to cool the liquid down. Passive cooling is much quieter than active cooling, which can be an
            advantage.</p>

    <!-- Motherboard -->
    <div>
        <h2>Motherboard</h2>
        <img class="section-image"
             src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/MicroATX_Motherboard_with_AMD_Athlon_Processor_2_Digon3.jpg"
             alt="Motherboard">
        <p>A motherboard is the main PCB (printed circuit board) found in computers. It holds and allows communication
            between many of the electronic components of a system, such as the CPU and memory; it also provides
            connectors for peripherals. If the CPU is the brain of the computer, the motherboard is the heart.</p>
        <p>As seen above, motherboards have many slots and connectors to attach parts to. There are RAM slots, USB
            connectors, SATA connectors (for storage), and more. The motherboard connects to most of the essential parts
            of the computer, so it is essential in itself.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Memory -->
    <div>
        <h2>Memory</h2>
        <img class="section-image"
             src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/RAM_SDRAM_256MB_133MHz_SIL3246.jpg" alt="RAM">
        <p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is a random-access memory device, so it allows data items to be read or written in
            almost the same amount of time regardless of the physical location of the data inside the memory. This
            allows RAM to read and write memory relatively quickly.</p>
        <p>This kind of memory is much better than CDs or hard disks because it can read and write memory much faster.
            However, it can't replace memory such as HDD or SSD because RAM is volatile - when the computer is powered
            down, all data stored in the RAM is lost. Howwever, it is great for running programs that require quickly
            accessible memory, such as games or chat applications.</p>
        <p>RAM fits into slots in the motherboard to connect to the computer. In a way, it's like the brain's short
            therm memory system, and it's connected to the heart (the motherboard). Many computers have around 8-16
            gigabytes of RAM, which is a decent size for regular use and for gaming.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ROM -->
    <div>
        <h2>ROM</h2>
        <img class="section-image"
             src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Pmod-serial-flash-rom-16-mbit.jpg" alt="ROM">
        <p>ROM (Read-Only Memory) is a type of non-volatile memory that can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or
            not at all. ROM is mainly used to store firmware, which is software that is closely tied to specific
            hardware and is unlikely to need frequent updates. It is also used to sore application software in plug-in
            cartridges.</p>
        <p>However, ROM is outdated now because of its near inability to be modified. Also, it has a very low storage
            capacity - even lower than RAM. HDD and SSD are used instead of ROM because they are non-volatile and they
            can also be modified easily.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Coprocessor -->
    <div>
        <h2>Coprocessor</h2>
        <img class="section-image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/80386with387.JPG"
             alt="coprocessor">
        <p>A coprocessor supplements the abilities of a regular CPU. It can perform extra arithmetic, logical, and I/O
            operations to increase processing speed. Some coprocessors are integrated directly into a CPU, but some are
            capable of working by themselves. As shown in the picture above, the coprocessor can be next to the CPU on
            the motherboard.</p>
