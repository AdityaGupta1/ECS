    <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Nikola Tesla is not a name that many people know. When people think of electricity,
        they often think of people like Thomas Edison or Michael Faraday. Sure, Edison invented the lightbulb and
        Faraday made huge contributions to electromagnetism, but Tesla was a genius as well. He invented a motor that
        runs on alternating current, which is one of the two dominant types of electricity (the other is direct
        current). He also thought up many other inventions, such as:

    <ul>
        <li>A radio-controlled wireless boat (one of the first wireless devices)</li>
        <li>A way to create artificial lightning</li>
        <li>A steam-powered mechanical oscillator</li>
        <li>A VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) biplane</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p> Much of his work has been obscured by other inventors and other inventions, but he really made a lot of
        interesting devices. This webpage aims to show off some of those while giving readers more information about
        Nikola Tesla. </p>
    <h3>Early Life</h3>

    <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Nikola Tesla was born on July 10<sup>th</sup>, 1856, in what is now Croatia. His
        father was a priest and his mother managed the family farm. His family moved to Gospić, Austrian Empire, in
        1862. He first became interested in electricty in his physics class. One demonstration that particularly
        interested him was a "radiometer the professor had built out of a bulb and tinfoil" (Wikipedia, “Nikola Tesla”).
        He stated that he wanted to learn more about electricity. </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> In 1874, Tesla managed to evade the draft in Smiljan by running away to Tomingaj, a
        town near Gračac. A year later, he went to Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria, on a scholarship, and in his
        first year, he "never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams (nearly twice as
        many as required), [and] started a Serb culture club" (Wikipedia, "Nikola Tesla"). However, in his second year,
        he lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling. He gambled his allowance and tuition money away, but
        later gambled it back. He never graduated from the university. </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> After that, he jumped around a lot. First, he severed all ties with family and
        friends so that they wouldn't know he dropped out of school. Then he moved to present-day Slovenia where he
        worked at a draftsman before being sent back to his hometown of Gospić due to his lack of a residence permit. In
        1880, two of Tesla's uncles gathered enough money to help him go to Prague, where he studied. He moved to
        Budapest in 1881, where he again worked as a draftsman. Finally, in 1882, he moved to France and began working
        for the Continental Edison Company. </p>
    <h3>Tesla and Edison</h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> After Tesla moved to France in 1882, he began working for the Continental Edison
        Company, where he worked with different types of electrical equipment. In June of 1884, he moved to New York
        City, and he would stay in the U.S.A. for the rest of his life. He was hired by Thomas Edison to work at his
        Edison Machine Works, where Tesla quickly went from doing simple electrical engineering to solving more complex
        problems. </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Edison asked Tesla to work on completely redesigining the company's DC (direct
        current) generators. Tesla said he could make huge improvements to them, and Edison said that he "would pay
        $50,000 for an improved design for his DC dynamos" (History, "Nikola Tesla"). Tesla was easily able to do this,
        but when he presented his solution to Edison and asked for his payment, Edison said that it was just a joke and
        offered a $10 raise instead. Tesla refused and immediately resigned from Edison's company. </p>
    <h3>Tesla's Contributions to Computer Science</h3>

        <caption align="bottom">
            Tesla's AC Induction Motor

        <tr>
            <td><img style="width:200px; float:right;"

        </tr>
    </table>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> After he left Edison's company, Tesla made some very important discoveries. Arguably
        the most important of these was his invention of an induction motor that ran on AC (alternating current), which
        was a relatively new system of current at the time. His work with AC and his public demonstrations of its
        features helped popularize it. This also helped in the "War of Currents", in which Edison's DC battled with AC
        for public attention and usage. AC was important to computer science because it is used widely today. Wall
        outlets produce alternating current because it is the most efficient way to transport power from power plants to
        homes. Tesla's motor is used in a variety of industry and houeshold appliances today. However, there's more -
        "Tesla’s greatest achievement is his polyphase alternating current system, which is today lighting the entire
        globe" (Tesla Memorial Society, "Tesla Biography"). This shows that Tesla's work still has a huge impact
        today. </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Tesla also worked with X-rays, and some of his early experiments included cold
        cathode tubes. This type of cathode doesn't need a filament to heat it up. Tesla's discovieries with X-rays were
        relevant to computer science because cold cathode tubes were used in some vacuum tubes, which were central
        components of early computers. Tesla's cathode tubes were very new technology at his time. Other people started
        to make similar tubes a few decades after Tesla - for example, one of my group members wrote about the <a
                href="http://cs.bcp.org/cozort/ecs/cozfall16/inoue_aidan/">Williams-Kilburn tube</a>. Another one of my
        group memebers made a webpage about the first computer - <a
                href="http://cs.bcp.org/cozort/ecs/cozfall16/raphael_kevin/">Colossus</a>. This computer used vacuum
        tubes to function, and Tesla's cold cathode tubes were a predecessor of vacuum tubes.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> After his endeavors into X-rays, Tesla worked on radio technology. He created one of
        the first wirelessly controlled devices - a radio-controlled boat. He demonstrated this to the public at an
        electrical exhibition, and since they hadn't seen anything like it, they "made outrageous claims about the
        workings of the boat, such as magic, telepathy, and being piloted by a trained monkey hidden inside" (Wikipedia,
        "Nikola Tesla"). These innovations in radio are important because they were some of the first wireless
        inventions. Today, we use wireless networking and connection heavily, so its surprising that it was already
        being talked about 100 years ago. However, Tesla initially didn't receive the credit he deserved. Instead, a man
        named Guglielmo Marconi took all the credit for making a working radio system, but Tesla knew that Marconi's
        work was largely based off of some of Tesla's patented inventions. In 1943, the year of Tesla's death, the U.S.
        Supreme Court restored Tesla's patents and gave him the recognition he worked for. </p>
    <h3>Tesla's Later Years</h3>

    <!-- Wardenclyffe Tower picture -->
    <table style="float:right; border: 2px solid gray;">
        <caption align="bottom">
            Wardenclyffe Tower
        </caption>
        <tr>
            <td><img style="width:200px; float:right;" src="http://www.teslasociety.com/pictures/wardenc.jpg"
                     alt="Wardenclyffe Tower"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> When Tesla finished with his radio work, he began construction on Wardenclyffe Tower,
        where he would try to work on wireless communication and more advanced radio signals. However, his financial
        backer, J.P. Morgan, refused to give him more funding after his initial funding ran out. This stopped the
        tower's construction, and in that time, Marconi transmitted the letter "S" from England to Newfoundland, beating
        Tesla to be the first person to make such a transmission. Tesla never finished the tower and he was later forced
        to sell it for a little over 10% of its purchase price. </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> After Wardenclyffe Tower, much of Tesla's work fell into obscurity, which may have
        been a good thing. He was working on devices like a "death ray", and a "directed energy weapon", which may not
        have been the best thing for the world to have - World War II was coming up and nobody would want more death and
        destruction than there already was. Tesla died on January 7, 1983. He was alone in his room in the New Yorker
        Hotel and his body was found when his maid came to his room two days after his death. The FBI ordered the Alien
        Property Custodian to seize Tesla's belongings even though he was an American citizen. They probably wanted to
        keep things like the death ray out of the hands of the public, but we'll never know for sure. </p>
    <p style="text-indent:50px;"> Tesla was an underappreciated genius who contributed to early and modern computer
        science. His work was often overshadowed by more well-known names like Thomas Edison, but his contributions will
        not be forgotten. To learn more about Tesla, go to the Wikipedia article about him at <a
